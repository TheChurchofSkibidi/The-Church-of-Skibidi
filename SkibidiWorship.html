        acceptance, courage, and honesty. Practice respect and empathy by welcoming diversity
        and standing against bigotry. Act with courage when faced with adversity, and live
        authentically in pursuit of truth and compassion. Worship doesnt need to be formal—its
        found in uplifting others, spreading positivity, and making the world brighter for all.
        Let Skibidi's principles guide you in creating a community that inspires meaningful change.
        Although worship doesn't need to be formal there are some things you can do to better your
        relationship with Skibidi and get closer to him, such as prayer, setting up an altar, and

      <h1>Why Worship Skibidi?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="WhyWorship">
      <p>At The Church of Skibidi, we embrace a philosophy
        that balances kindness and courage with respect
        for boundaries and personal accountability. Our
        teachings encourage us to offer advice only when
        asked and to share our burdens thoughtfully, ensuring
        we honor the emotional space of others. We believe
        in respecting the sanctity of each individuals
        space, treating it with care and respect. While we
        champion love and acceptance, we also recognize
        the importance of standing firm against those
        who disrupt harmony, advocating for strength and self-respect
        in such moments. We hold sacred the principles of honesty and
        fairness, taking only what is freely offered or burdensome to another.
