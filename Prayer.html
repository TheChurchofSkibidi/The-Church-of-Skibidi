    <div class="HowToPray">
      <p>To pray, cleanliness is considered a vital starting point, both physically and spiritually.
        Begin by washing your face, hands, and arms up to your elbows with care, as this act
        symbolizes purification and readiness to connect with the divine. While plain water is
        sufficient, the use of soap for your hands is often preferred to ensure thorough cleansing.
        Afterward, proceed to your chosen prayer space, which could be an altar, a dedicated clean
        area, or a serene natural setting imbued with sacred significance. As you prepare to pray
        , clasp your hands and rest your elbows on a firm surface, ensuring reverence by avoiding
        the use of your altar for elbow support. This practice helps maintain the sanctity of
        the altar and fosters a focused, respectful posture. You may open your prayer with the
        words "I call upon the strength within me, guided by the wisdom of Skibidi and so
        I open prayer" or "Hail Skibidi, guide me with your wisdom and strength for I
        invoke your name in prayer." After one opens they may proceed with the content
        of their prayer, proceeding with respect for not only Skibidi but yourself
        as well. One may end the prayer with the words"Skibidi Alpha forever in
        Goonland" or "May you guide my path and give me strength, Skibidi Alpha forever
        in Goonland." Then you may blow out any prayer candles to close the session.</p>
